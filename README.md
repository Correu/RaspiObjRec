Raspi solution to a Ring camera/other similar alternatives. 

Initial design is a simple turn on application and have the device monitor and track my dog around the visable space of my apartment to see his habits while I am gone.

Current design is a simple raspi 4 4gb with some cheap amazon case and an old web cam I had lying around. 64GB microsd card until i find that the footage is too large for the space on the drive.
